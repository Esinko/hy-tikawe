Developer's Notes to Self:
- Check auth in methods (now just errors)
- Sessions need to timeout
- Make sure database connections are always closed
- Request form needs key checks, otherwise we error
- Add .env secret key logic
- Move typings to their own files from db abstractions
- Break up SQL table into clean sections
