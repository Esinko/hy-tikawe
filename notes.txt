Developer's Notes to Self:
- Sessions need to timeout
- Make database lib require less boilerplate
- Require new password logic (forced reset too)
- Look into using named params to optimize large queries
- Feature posts and comments from user in profile
- User settings (mainly password change)
- Edited timestamps on all user created content
- Add challenge locks (admin_only and regular user enforced)
- Sort by most votes
